A new girl at school, Brooks, informs him that he's destined to release an evil god from the ancient Maya relic he is imprisoned in\u2014unless she can find and remove it first. Together they return to the volcano, where all kinds of crazy happens. Brooks turns into a hawk, a demon attacks them in a cave, and Rosie gives her all while trying to protect Zane.
