These fourteen critical essays examine both the role of science fiction in the third world and the role of the third world in science fiction. Topics covered include science fiction in Bengal, the genre's portrayal of Native Americans, Mexican cyberpunk fiction, and the undercurrents of colonialism and Empire in traditional science fiction. The intersections of science fiction theory and postcolonial theory are explored, as well as science fiction's contesting of imperialism and how the third world uses the genre to recreate itself.

From its African origins, The River Where Blood Is Born carves a course across two centuries and three continents, from the eighteenth-century Gold Coast through the perilous Middle Passage, from antebellum Barbados to forty acres in turn-of-the-century Illinois. Its rambling river runs to Chicago in the 1960s and climbs the mountains of North Carolina and Montreal in the '70s, crosses over to London in the '80s, and makes other world wanderings before bending back toward Africa in the '90s. It is in this time and place that, at last, a chosen daughter is summoned home. But what must she sacrifice to honor the River Mother's call? That question is at the heart of this remarkable novel.

Best known as the founder of the modern Japanese detective novel, Ranpo wrote for a youthful audience, and a taste for playacting and theatre animates his stories.

Characterized by an almost lurid fascination with simulacra and illusion, the era\u2019s sensibility permeates Ranpo's first major work and one of his finest achievements, Strange Tale of Panorama Island (Panoramato kidan), published in 1926.", "Ranpo\u2019s panorama island is filled with cleverly designed optical illusions: a staircase rises into the sky; white feathered \u201cbirds\u201d speak in women\u2019s voices and offer to serve as vehicles; clusters of naked men and women romp on slopes carpeted with rainbow-colored flowers. His fantastical utopia is filled with entrancing music and strange sweet odors, and nothing is ordinary, predictable, or boring. The novella reflected the new culture of mechanically produced simulated realities (movies, photographs, advertisements, stereoscopic and panoramic images) and focused on themes of the doppelganger and appropriated identities: its main character steals the identity of an acquaintance. The novella\u2019s utopian vision, argues translator Elaine Gerbert, mirrors the expansionist dreams that fed Japan's colonization of the Asian continent, its ending an eerie harbinger of the collapse of those dreams.", "Today just as a new generation of technologies is transforming the way we think\u2014and becoming ever more invasive and pervasive\u2014Ranpo's work is attracting a new generation of readers.

This \u201cdreaming in public\u201d becomes common culture and part of what transforms immigrants and \u201cnative\u201d born into Americans. Redwood, an African American woman, and Aidan, a Seminole Irish man, journey from Georgia to Chicago, from haunted swampland to a \u201ccity of the future.\u201d They are gifted performers and hoodoo conjurors, struggling to call up the wondrous world they imagine, not just on stage and screen, but on city streets, in front parlors, in wounded hearts. The power of hoodoo is the power of the community that believes in its capacities to heal and determine the course of today and tomorrow. Living in a system stacked against them, Redwood and Aidan\u2019s power and talent are torment and joy. Their search for a place to be who they want to be is an exhilarating, painful, magical adventure.

Instead of coasting on his success (Bill Clinton is a fan), in 1998 he took a left turn and published Blue Light, an allegorical sort-of science fiction novel that never quite found its voice, although it was a New York Times Notable Book. Blue Light must have been Mosley's SF false start, because Futureland rocks and roars from the first page. ", "Ostensibly a collection of short stories, Futureland reads more like a William Gibson novel. Minor characters in one story are major characters in another story, which gives the reader that MTV jump-cut sensation, but not so frantic with Mosley as it is with Gibson. ", "And what characters! The charm of Mosley's earlier books is that the characters are normal people in historical settings, getting by as best they can. But in Futureland the reader encounters the heavyweight boxing champion of the world (female); the most intelligent human ever; the mad scientist at the head of the world's largest corporation. These characters are neither normal nor historical. ", "So with sly nods to Hegel and DeLillo, Mosley abandons history and the common man. It's a great privilege for a reader to watch a good writer change his mind. In an essay on his website Mosley claims to have been an SF fan all his life. He knows the genre; he knows the language (before he published his first novel he was a computer programmer); and he knows that there is no better venue to change your mind than SF. ", "Mosley retains some of his favorite themes, though. All the exceptional characters in the book are full members of lively communities. The best story in the book-no surprise-is about a private eye. Like most hardboiled detectives, Folio Johnson needs friends on the force and on the street to survive. Unlike Easy Rawlins, though, he also needs wetware implants to keep from going down. ", "And race pervades this book like it pervades all Mosley's books. It is a theme handled well in all of the stories except for the final one (\"The Nig in Me,\" go figure), where it is too over-the-top, and detracts from a lightweight story that was an SF clich\u00e9 in the first place. ", "Also in the essay on his website, Mosley asserts that the next five years will see a wave of black SF writers. If Mosley stays with this genre, he'll lead them. He's as good as anyone writing SF today.", "_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _", "Futureland is bestselling mystery author Walter Mosley's first science fiction book since Blue Light, a New York Times Notable Book of the Year. Futureland's nine linked stories will provide an accessible and intelligent introduction to written science fiction for mystery or mainstream fiction fans who do not normally read the genre. Experienced science fiction readers, however, may be less than satisfied with Futureland. Reading it, you might decide Mr. Mosley grew up reading SF, respects the genre, and still watches SF movies, but has read little SF written during or after the New Wave of the 1960s. However, something more may be going on here than a genre newcomer making beginning-SF-writer mistakes. Mr. Mosley may be deliberately, and craftily, creating SF accessible to his large non-SF readership and to others who are strangers to this genre. Some have labeled Futureland cyberpunk, and it does present a dark, infotech-saturated, corporation-controlled future; but it is in fact an inversion of cyberpunk. Instead of that subgenre's cliche of cool, cutting-edge, street-smart, but not very believable outlaws who out-hack and outwit powerful multinational corporations, this Dante-esque collection presents outlaws and outcasts who may be street-wise, but who have little chance of overcoming the corporations and governments that control, and sometimes take, their lives. Like shockingly few other SF works, Futureland directly examines the lives of the working and the nonworking classes, the poor and the marginalized, the criminal and the criminalized. In other words, Futureland is set in a world quite alien to many veteran SF readers, and is therefore a book they should try. --Cynthia Ward"], "author": "Walter Mosley", "num_pages": "356", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2001-11-12 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0446529540"},
