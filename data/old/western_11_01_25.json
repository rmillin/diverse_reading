It\u2019s a belief fraught with peril, threatening both Rutledge\u2019s professional stature and his faith in his judgment. But there is a darker reason for Rutledge\u2019s reluctance. Murder brings him back to Kent where, days earlier, he\u2019d glimpsed an all-too-familiar face beyond the leaping flames of a bonfire. Soon an unexpected encounter revives the end of his own war, as the country prepares for a somber commemoration on the anniversary of the Armistice. To battle the unsettled past and the haunted present at the same time is an appalling mandate. ", "And the people around him? Among them the attractive widow of a friend, a remarkable woman who survived the Great Indian Mutiny; a bitter, dying barrister; and a man whose name he never knew\u2014unwittingly compete with the grieving Nell Shaw. They\u2019ll demand more than Rutledge can give, unaware that he is already carrying the burden of shell shock\u2014and the voice of Hamish MacLeod, the soldier he was forced to execute in the war. The killer in Marling is surprisingly adept at escaping detection. And Ben Shaw\u2019s past is a tangle of unsettling secrets that may or may not be true. Rutledge must walk a tortuous line between two murderers...one reaching out to ruin him, the other driven to destroy him."], "author": "Charles Todd", "num_pages": "384", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2003-07-29 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0553583174"},

Meanwhile, Eeva is drawn back to Helsinki, to the comrades of her childhood, and in particular to Lauri, the son of her father's friend. It is a world full of danger. For this is Finland in political ferment - the power of the Russian Empire over its subject peoples is growing more oppressive, but resistance to the Tsar's rule is growing too, both in Finland and in Russia. Some call such resistance terrorism; others call it a fight for freedom. Just as Helen Dunmore's \"The Siege\" is a novel about how huge public events bear down on private lives, so \"House of Orphans\", while a spellbinding story of love and loneliness is also about the tension between reform and revolution, and a country emerging into Independence."], "author": "Helen Dunmore", "num_pages": "368", "awards": ["Orange Prize Nominee for Fiction Longlist (2006)"], "places": ["Helsinki"], "character_names": ["Eeva", "Thomas Eklund", "Lauri"], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2006-01-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0670914525"},

Soon Vera and Joe are on their way to the south Northumberland town of Mardle, where Margaret lived, to begin their inquiry. Then, just days later, a second woman is murdered.

Despite a prickly relationship and very different lives, they've never quite lost touch with each other - or with their former teacher, Libor Sevcik, a Czechoslovakian always more concerned with the wider world than with exam results. Now, both Libor and Finkler are recently widowed, and with Treslove, his chequered and unsuccessful record with women rendering him an honorary third widower, they dine at Libor's grand, central London apartment. It's a sweetly painful evening of reminiscence in which all three remove themselves to a time before they had loved and lost; a time before they had fathered children, before the devastation of separations, before they had prized anything greatly enough to fear the loss of it. Better, perhaps, to go through life without knowing happiness at all because that way you had less to mourn? Treslove finds he has tears enough for the unbearable sadness of both his friends' losses. And it's that very evening, at exactly 11:30pm, as Treslove hesitates a moment outside the window of the oldest violin dealer in the country as he walks home, that he is attacked. After this, his whole sense of who and what he is will slowly and ineluctably change."], "author": "Howard Jacobson", "num_pages": "307", "awards": ["Man Booker Prize (2010)", "Jewish Quarterly-Wingate Prize Nominee (2011)", "International DUBLIN Literary Award Nominee (2012)"], "places": [], "character_names": ["Julian Treslove", "Sam Finkler", "Libor Sevcik", "Hephzibah Weizenbaum"], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2010-08-02 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1408808870"},

When a member of West End Central becomes intrigued by Rasmussen's behaviour, the reluctant James Ross finds himself dragooned into keeping a close watch over Suzi's boss.

Five victims; four of them killed with military efficiency and, judging from the wounds, a military bayonet. The fifth victim, the lady of the house, is found nearly naked, sprawled on a bed, her throat slashed with a razor. Even more startling than the actual carnage are two subsequent findings: the lack of any sort of sexual assault and the discovery of a child - a young girl hiding beneath a bed.", "Scotland Yard sends out Inspector John Madden to investigate the murders. Madden, with some heavy psychological baggage of his own courtesy of the war, recognizes the mark of madness in the killer's work and has a unique understanding of the killer's methods, habits, and rituals. While the local constabulary figures the murders for a robbery gone horribly wrong, Madden is quick to recognize the presence of a more sinister motive. He seeks the help of Dr. Helen Blackwell, a local physician who lost both her brothers and her husband to the war. Dr. Blackwell's professional connections include a Viennese psychiatrist who is well versed in the relatively new field of forensic psychology, and together they try to develop a psychological profile for the killer.", "The deeper Madden digs into the case, the harder it is for him to maintain the fragile wall he has built around his own painful memories. A spark between him and Helen Blackwell quickly becomes an all-consuming fire, and in the tender exploratory phase of their relationship, Helen gently urges him to face his personal demons head-on. ", "Meanwhile, Madden discovers the killer has struck once before, a murder that was left unsolved. When Madden gets the idea to look for similar crimes that may have occurred during the war, he finds one, and a clearer and even more frightening picture of the killer begins to evolve. As the police investigation proceeds, plodding at times and getting fortuitous breaks at others, the killer plans his next attack. Together, killer and cops move along parallel timelines, a loose scrabble of concurrent events held together by a taut string of tension. When the string finally breaks, it culminates in a vivid and terrifying climax that demonstrates how fine a line often exists between sanity and utter madness. ", " is the first book in a promised series. Inspector John Madden is precisely the type of multifaceted and complex character readers will enjoy meeting time and again. And the supporting cast of characters is the perfect complement, the sum total being a rich and full-bodied story.

In delicate, intricately observed closeup, we witness the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: the man with painfully scarred hands who tried in vain to save his wife from a burning house and who must now care for his young daughter alone; a group of young clubgoers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love.

The worst thing about drug dealing\u2014according to our unnamed narrator\u2014whether you're a classy top dealer trading millions or a down-and-out street pusher, is that you have to relate to a lot of total idiots - loudmouths and tough-guy wannabes who aren't afraid to \"get nicked by old bill and thrown in the boob\" (arrested by police and jailed). Our narrator is a smoothly diplomatic 29-year-old cocaine dealer who has earned a respected place among England's Mafia elite. Speaking in a language rich with drug jargon, vulgarities, British slang, and Cockneyisms, he manages high-level trafficking with a tough old veteran partner, Mister Mortimer, a man who gave the narrator his start in the business, and who has seen his share of prison (five and a half year term) and deadly fights (he owns a porn store, and loves to set up guys looking for child porn by directing them to come back at a special time, then beating the living daylights out of them when they return). Our narrator\u2019s goal is to retire at 30 and spend his remaining years far from the danger and double-dealing of London's crime gangs. But like most high rollers, he finds it hard to walk away from \"just one more\" deal.", "Morty rings up our narrator one early Saturday morning with an invitation to an exclusive members only restaurant far off in the English countryside. They\u2019re off for \u201ca spot of luncheon\u201d with the Don, Jimmy Price. Jimmy is a legend, a crime boss who\u2019s been in the business for years by hiring the best lawyers and keeping a low-key profile. This is a man who is always gets what he wants, and is not used to people refusing him favors. Which is exactly the spot our narrator soon finds himself in when over lunch, Jimmy hands down a tough assignment: find Charlotte Ryder, the missing rich princess daughter of Jimmy's old pal Edward, a powerful construction business player and gossip papers socialite. It\u2019s a hard deal to refuse, but Jimmy can spot the edge on our narrator and makes him a deal \u2013 if you find Charlotte, you can leave the life for good.", "Our narrator sets out to find Billy Bogus, a grifter with a gift for mimicry and ingratiating himself into any area of society he wants. Bank and credit card fraud is his trade, with a healthy dollop of hustling young women out of their trust funds for good measure. On his way to meet Bogus, he runs into a small time punk named Sid in a local nightclub who runs with a band of thugs called \u201cthe Yahoos.\u201d With him is a stunning woman, a \u201creal love-a-player type\u201d named Tammy. Sid tells our narrator a bloody story about a friend of his named \u201cThe Duke\u201d who recently got ambushed by a state of the art crew armed with laser sighted Uzis. Our narrator won\u2019t figure out the significance of this story until later as he\u2019s too busy checking out Tammy, who flirtatiously gives him her number while Sid is distracted.", "Our narrator reports to Jimmy\u2019s right hand man, Gene, that he\u2019s on the case, but Gene has other business. Turns out that the Yahoos have two million pounds' worth of Grade A ecstasy to sell, and Gene wants our narrator to handle the deal. It\u2019s an irresistible deal, just the right amount of money to top off his retirement fund. He sets up a meeting with him, Mort, and the Yahoos kingpins, Big Frankie and JD while finally catching up with Billy Bogus, who agrees to help find our narrator Charlotte by tracking down Charlotte\u2019s boyfriend Kinky\u2014for a price, of course.", "Big Frankie and JD keep quiet about where they\u2019ve gotten the tablets, but the \u201cgear\u201d is top quality, confirmed by none other than Sir Alex (\u201cchief chemical taster\u201d). Things are looking up when Mort sets up his gang to meet up with a crew, headed by a man named Trevor, up in Northern England who he thinks will be perfect to unload the goods on. There\u2019s only one problem \u2013 they don\u2019t want the goods. This crew informs our narrator that an Ecstasy factory has been hijacked\u2014most likely by the Yahoos\u2014and now a brutal neo-Nazi sect wants those pills back. They\u2019ve already hit up a house that belongs to \u201cthe Duke\u201d, and here is where Sid\u2019s story from the club all makes sense.", "Our narrator drives back to London with Mort in tow and gets a call from Bogus, who tells him he\u2019s found Kinky. Dead. In a London housing project. It looks like a typical drug overdose, but a young kid drug dealer who helped Bogus find Kinky says he was murdered.", "Meanwhile, our narrator sets up a rendezvous with Tammy in a hotel room. As he steps out of the shower, two toughs ambush him, who roll him up in a carpet, and abduct him in a long box. The toughs take him to a construction site to meet with their boss, Eddie Ryder, Charlotte\u2019s father. Eddie tells our narrator that Jimmy Price has pulled a fast one on him \u2013 his daughter\u2019s isn\u2019t missinnnnnng. What\u2019s worse, Jimmy\u2019s made a deal with some renegade Chechens that have swindled him to the tune of thirteen million pounds. To pull himself out of the hole, he set up the narrator to find Eddie\u2019s daughter, then hold her for ransom. The double cross, though, turns into a triple cross when Eddie plays our narrator a tape that reveals Jimmy Price is an informer for the police and has set up a sting for our narrator where he plans to send him to jail for long time, and make off with the narrator\u2019s retirement fund.", "Finding himself undercut, double-crossed, hung out to dry, and struggling to survive, our narrator\u2019s survival instincts kick in. He changes from a turn-the-other-cheek diplomat to a revenge-charged hit man overnight, starting by killing Jimmy Price. Next, he agrees to sell the ecstasy tablets to Ryder, who plans to unload them to the Yakuza in Japan, which will put a nice chunk of change in our narrator\u2019s pocket. Just before he leaves, our narrator mentions a bit of dirt that Jimmy gave him in passing about Eddie, insuring that Eddie won\u2019t kill our narrator\u2014just in case he gets any funny ideas about doing so.", "Suddenly, all of the narrator\u2019s problems looked solved. Jimmy\u2019s dead, and those two million tabs of ecstasy are headed to Japan. Then, Jimmy\u2019s right hand man Gene asks for a meeting with Mort and our narrator. Gene accuses our narrator of killing Jimmy and threatens to kill him unless he confesses. Our narrator plays the tape Ryder gave him for Gene and Morty, revealing Jimmy\u2019s double-dealings with the police. Gene lets our narrator go and agrees never to discuss the crime again.", "All that remains is the little matter of two million tabs of ecstasy. In a flourish of double and triple crosses, our narrator\u2019s deal to exchange the tabs for cash at Heathrow Airport falls apart, but ends up with the tabs in Amsterdam. As he prepares to dash off to Amsterdam to collect the loot, he decides to give Tammy a call before he leaves. Unfortunately, Tammy\u2019s jealous boyfriend Sidney tailed her, and shot the narrator three times, including twice in the head. The narrator lived, recovered in the hospital, and is ordered into retirement and exile by the cops. He rings Tammy to offer her one more chance to meet, but she tells him \u201cgirls like dangerous guys but you\u2019re seriously fuckin\u2019 life threatening. How many girls do you know end up covered in blood, chief prosecution witness in an attempted murder trial on their first date?\u201d She wishes our narrator well, who has plenty of time to reflect on his life as an ex-pat in Curacao, Brazil. He acknowledges that, in life, you never stop learning, but you never stop forgetting either. He has plenty of time now to ruminate on both, living a life where he can remember why he left the business, but never forget why he can\u2019t tell us his name."], "author": "J.J.

However, the escalating dispute between upstart Tommy Telford and Big Ger Cafferty's gang soon gives Rebus an escape clause. Telford is known to have close ties to a man nicknamed Mr. Pink Eyes, a brutal gangster running a lucrative business bringing Chechen refugees into Britain to work as prostitutes. And when Rebus takes under his wing a distraught Bosnian call girl, it gives him a personal reason to make sure Telford takes the high road out of town.

William Boyd's novel Any Human Heart is his disjointed autobiography, a massive tome chronicling \"my personal rollercoaster\"--or rather, \"not so much a rollercoaster\", but a yo-yo, \"a jerking spinning toy in the hands of a maladroit child.\" From his early childhood in Montevideo, son of an English corned beef executive and his Uraguayan secretary, through his years at a Norfolk public school and Oxford, Mountstuart traces his haphazard development as a writer. Early and easy success is succeeded by a long half-century of mediocrity, disappointments and setbacks, both personal and professional, leading him to multiple failed marriages, internment, alcoholism and abject poverty.", "Mountstuart's sorry tale is also the story of a British way of life in inexorable decline, as his journey takes in the Bloomsbury set, the General Strike, the Spanish Civil War, 1930s Americans in Paris, wartime espionage, New York avant garde art, even the Baader-Meinhof gang--all with a stellar supporting cast. The most sustained and best moment comes mid-book, as Mountstuart gets caught up in one of Britain's murkier wartime secrets, in the company of the here truly despicable Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Elsewhere author William Boyd occasionally misplaces his tongue too obviously in his cheek--the Wall Street Crash is trailed with truly crashing inelegance--but overall Any Human Heart is a witty, inventive and ultimately moving novel. Boyd succeeds in conjuring not only a compelling 20th century but also, in the hapless Logan Mountstuart, an anti-hero who achieves something approaching passive greatness. --Alan Stewart, Amazon.co.uk"], "author": "William  Boyd", "num_pages": "480", "awards": ["Man Booker Prize Nominee for Longlist (2002)", "Prix Jean-Monnet de litt\u00e9rature europ\u00e9enne du d\u00e9partement de Charente (2003)", "International DUBLIN Literary Award Nominee (2004)"], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2004-01-06 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1400031001"},
