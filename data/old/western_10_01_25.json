Dr Iannis practices medicine on the island of Cephalonia, accompanied by his daughter, Pelagia, to whom he imparts much of his healing art. Even when the Italians do invade, life isn\u2019t so bad\u2014at first anyway. The officer in command of the Italian garrison is the cultured Captain Antonio Corelli, who responds to a Nazi greeting of \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d with his own \u201cHeil Puccini\u201d, and whose most precious possession is his mandolin. It isn't long before Corelli and Pelagia are involved in a heated affair--despite her engagement to a young fisherman, Mandras, who has gone off to join Greek partisans. Love is complicated enough in wartime, even when the lovers are on the same side. And for Corelli and Pelagia, it becomes increasingly difficult to negotiate the minefield of allegiances, both personal and political, as all around them atrocities mount, former friends become enemies and the ugliness of war infects everyone it touches. ", "British author Louis de Berni\u00e8res is well known for his forays into magical realism in such novels as The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts, Se\u00f1or Vivo and the Coca Lord and The Troublesome Offspring of Cardinal Guzman.

The protagonist, Leonard Marnham, is a 25-year-old, naive, unsophisticated English post office technician who is astonished and alarmed to find himself involved in a top-secret operation. At the same time that he loses his political innocence, Leonard experiences his sexual initiation in a clandestine affair with a German divorcee five years his senior. As his two secret worlds come together, events develop into a gruesome nightmare, building to a searing, unforgettable scene of surrealist intensity in which Leonard and his lover try to conceal evidence of a murder. Acting to save himself from a prison sentence, Leonard desperately performs an act of espionage whose ironic consequences resonate down the years to a twister of an ending.

The only people in all of Hell who seem to care at all are Charles' co-worker, Jocelyn, and a demon taxi driver called Pudenda. Nothing about the place is fair or reasonable and there is nothing that anybody can do about it. From the Vengeance Is Mine versus An Eye For An Eye court case, through murderous team building with Viking raiders and a special Hellympic Games, Hell seems to have gotten itself lost in a mire of rules and compliance. Can Charles make sense of it all before Hell grinds him down to a terrified, quivering mess, or will he just keep his head down and do as he is told?", " is a short novel about life, sin, the afterlife, belief and doing the right thing.

Over time, however, it becomes apparent that \u2018evidence\u2019 is rather more definite than is opinion, which is all that religious (and political) certainty really boils down to.

Treading that path sees us kill each other in huge numbers because, give it long enough, and people eventually forget that these ideas they\u2019re living by are only ideas, and nothing more. The book is also about the perils of being a \u2018yes man\u2019, going along with things because it seems like the less perilous thing personally to do. You can do horrific things with the justification that others told you to do it, or \u2018made\u2019 you do it, but where does it stop?

The Dapple has its origin beyond the Debatable Hills to the west of Lud-in-the-Mist, in Fairyland. In the days of Duke Aubrey, some centuries earlier, fairy things had been looked upon with reverence, and fairy fruit was brought down the Dapple and enjoyed by the people of Dorimare. But after Duke Aubrey had been expelled from Dorimare by the burghers, the eating of fairy fruit came to be regarded as a crime, and anything related to Fairyland was unspeakable. Now, when his son Ranulph is believed to have eaten fairy fruit, Nathaniel Chanticleer, the mayor of Lud-in-the-Mist, finds himself looking into old mysteries in order to save his son and the people of his city."], "author": "Hope Mirrlees", "num_pages": "239", "awards": ["Prix Elbakin.net for Meilleur roman fantasy traduit (2016)"], "places": [], "character_names": ["Nathaniel Chanticleer", "Enydmion Leer", "Ranulph Chanticleer"], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2005-03-22 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1593600410"},

Henry Perowne is a contented man - a successful neurosurgeon, the devoted husband of Rosalind, a newspaper lawyer, and proud father of two grown-up children, one a promising poet, the other a talented blues musician. Unusually, he wakes before dawn, drawn to the window of his bedroom and filled with a growing unease. What troubles him as he looks out at the night sky is the state of the world - the impending war against Iraq, a gathering pessimism since 9/11, and a fear that his city, its openness and diversity, and his happy family life are under threat. Later, Perowne makes his way to his weekly squash game through London streets filled with hundreds of thousands of anti-war protestors. A minor car accident brings him into a confrontation with Baxter, a fidgety, aggressive, young man, on the edge of violence. To Perowne's professional eye, there appears to be something profoundly wrong with him. Towards the end of a day rich in incident and filled with Perowne's celebrations of life's pleasures - music, food, love, the exhilarations of sport and the satisfactions of exacting work - his family gathers for a reunion. But with the sudden appearance of Baxter, Perowne's earlier fears seem about to be realised. Ian McEwan's last novel, Atonement, was hailed as a masterpiece all over the world.

In the version he brought back from Switzerland, the 1st two sections of the poem\u2013The Burial of the Dead & A Game of Chess\u2013appeared under this title. This strange phrase is taken from Dickens' Our Mutual Friend, in which the widow Higden, says of her adopted foundling son Sloppy: \"You mightn't think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices.\" This would help the reader to understand that, while there are many different voices/speakers in the poem, there's one central consciousness. In the end, the title chosen was The Waste Land. In his 1st note to the poem he attributes the title to Jessie L. Weston's book on the Grail legend, From Ritual to Romance. The allusion is to the wounding of the Fisher King & the subsequent sterility of his lands. To restore the King & make his lands fertile again the Grail questor must ask \"What ails you?\" The poem's title is often mistakenly given as \"Waste Land\" or \"Wasteland\", dropping the article.

", "After suffering a miscarriage, followed by a heart attack and having stopped breathing in intensive care she signs herself out of the hospital, clothing caked in dried blood, because there\u2019s nobody at home to see to the animals. The following day Harpie berates herself for just sitting about moping all day on the sofa, so scrubs herself up and goes down the pub. The next day she walks four miles to the hospital to pick her car up, reasoning that \u201cthe walk might do me some good.\u201d You can\u2019t help but admire and applaud her efforts to keep her life on track, staying in work and as a single mum ensuring her child has a safe home life. ", "This book began as a social experiment in honesty after a debate among authors about how honest it's possible to be. Harpie set out to prove that everything can be written, the good, the bad and the shameful. There is nowhere that this woman won\u2019t go. If there\u2019s a line to cross, Harpie will stick out her chest and limbo under it, jump over it or dance through it with a glass of vodka in her hand while never spilling a drop.

He sets this story in the romantic world of the Mediterranean, moving the action from Venice to the island of Cyprus and giving it an even more exotic coloring with stories of Othello's African past. Shakespeare builds so many differences into his hero and heroine\u2014differences of race, of age, of cultural background\u2014that one should not, perhaps, be surprised that the marriage ends disastrously. But most people who see or read the play feel that the love that the play presents between Othello and Desdemona is so strong that it would have overcome all these differences were it not for the words and actions of Othello's standard-bearer, Iago, who hates Othello and sets out to destroy him by destroying his love for Desdemona. As Othello succumbs to Iago's insinuations that Desdemona is unfaithful, fascination\u2014which dominates the early acts of the play\u2014turns to horror, especially for the audience. We are confronted by spectacles of a generous and trusting Othello in the grip of Iago's schemes; of an innocent Desdemona, who has given herself up entirely to her love for Othello only to be subjected to his horrifying verbal and physical assaults, the outcome of Othello's mistaken convictions about her faithlessness."], "author": "William Shakespeare", "num_pages": "314", "awards": [], "places": ["Venice", "Cyprus"], "character_names": ["Iago", "Bianca", "Othello", "Miguel C\u00e1ssio", "Desd\u00eamona", "Emilia", "Rodrigo"], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2004-01-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0743477553"},

For Mr Norrell, their power is something to be cautiously controlled, while Jonathan Strange will always be attracted to the wildest, most perilous forms of magic. He becomes fascinated by the ancient, shadowy figure of the Raven King, a child taken by fairies who became king of both England and Faerie, and the most legendary magician of all. Eventually Strange's heedless pursuit of long-forgotten magic threatens to destroy not only his partnership with Norrell, but everything that he holds dear."], "author": "Susanna Clarke", "num_pages": "1006", "awards": ["Hugo Award for Best Novel (2005)", "Man Booker Prize Nominee for Longlist (2004)", "Nebula Award Nominee for Best Novel (2005)", "Locus Award for Best First Novel (2005)", "Guardian First Book Award Nominee (2004)", "World Fantasy Award for Best Novel (2005)", "Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature (2005)", "Book Sense Book of the Year Award for Adult Fiction (2005)", "Cena Akademie SFFH for Kniha roku (Book of the Year) (2007)"], "places": ["United Kingdom"], "character_names": ["Napoleon Bonaparte", "Jonathan Strange", "Gilbert Norrell", "George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron", "John Uskglass (The Raven King)", "John Childermass", "Vinculus", "Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool", "Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington", "Stephen Black", "John Segundus", "Mr. Honeyfoot", "Mrs. Honeyfoot", "Christopher Drawlight", "Henry Lascelles", "Jeremy Johns", "Arabella Woodhope Strange", "Laurence Strange", "Sir Walter Pole", "Lady Emma Wintertowne Pole", "Henry Woodhope", "John Hyde", "Dr. Lancelot Greysteel", "Louisa Greysteel", "Flora Greysteel", "Mrs Delgado"], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2006-08-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0765356155"},
