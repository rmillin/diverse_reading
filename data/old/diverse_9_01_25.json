Now, with Tree of Life, Conde turns her impassioned, epic eye to the chaos and upheaval of the twentieth century. Rapidly shifting back and forth between Guadeloupe and Harlem, moving from Haiti's desperate slums to the exclusive enclaves of the Parisian upper class, this deeply personal story traces one Guadeloupe family's rise from poverty to riches through several generations. The story begins with Albert, the forebear, who leaves an island plantation to work on the Panama Canal and out of the horror of prejudice and oppression, fierily recreates himself as a man of immense wealth. We learn about his sons: Jacob, doomed to carry on his father's business but yearning for a life of his own, and Jean, who rejects the privilege and riches that are his birthright and becomes a martyr to the struggling people of his tragic land; about his granddaughter, Thecla, who tries to find happiness through politics and men; and about Albert II, who meets his puzzling and heartbreaking end an ocean away from his family and his roots. The extraordinary tale is recounted by Coco, a contemporary female descendant, who finally reconciles herself to a past that has haunted her all her life. Like Segu and Children of Segu, Tree of Life is a grand historical pageant, overflowing with the interlocking tales of many lives, teeming with social, cultural, and political details. \"Rich and colorful and glorious\" was how Maya Angelou described Segu.

Still young and good looking, the admirably hardworking Ida Elisabeth attracts the attention of a successful lawyer, who possesses the manly virtues that her husband lacked. As she contemplates marrying again, Frithjof, now gravely sick, reenters her life. Unlike Undset's famous historical novels, which are set in medieval Norway, the story of Ida Elisabeth unfolds in the 1920s. As in Undset's other fiction, however, Ida Elisabeth poignantly illustrates how poor choices affect the course of a person's life and how the suffering endured because of grievous mistakes can become the means by which a love is purified. Even in her historical novels, the Nobel Prize-winning Undset tackled contemporary themes. With its setting in modern times, Ida Elisabeth examines the difficulties inherent in male-female relationships as they are experienced in contemporary society.

Back to the Congo, her vivid account of this journey, examines relentlessly the psychology and scenery of a country of unreconciled cities and peoples, a hash of post-colonial socialism and corruption under the regime of the ubiquitous President Mobutu, the site of both Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness and V.S. Naipaul's A Bend in the River. Joris's Zaire comes palpably and sensually alive on her passage out aboard the Fabiolaville with a handful of Europeans, tension rising in the gossipy racism of perpetual passengers Mr. and Mrs. Dewaeles and Father Bronek's riotous drinking and dancing, his obsessive nostalgia for Poland and reluctant obsession with Zaire. Landing near her late uncle's Bienga mission where he has attained a cult status, Joris moves south to the capital Kinshasa to explore its sprawling poverty and wild entertainment districts with Francois, a French biker whose Yamaha is covered with Zairian drawings. She then travels by black Mercedes into the rainforests of Gbadolite for the memorial service of Mama Mobutu, and travels out with Citoyen Bondo, the \"baron\" of Yolo who was backed by Mobutu during Africanization when his single bicycle blossomed into multiple plantations and who is charmed by Joris's familiarity with Zairian top forty. Drawn inevitably toward the magnetic darkness of the Kisangani of Conrad's Kurtz and Naipaul's Salim, Joris books passage on the Ebeya, a boat dragging barges packed with three thousand people, a floating village in constant danger of raids by the canoes of the riverbank villages it passes.

Viennese Short Stories assembles the fiction Canetti published in her lifetime between 1932-1937 aside from her two novels (The Yellow Street and The Tortoises). These stories appeared in Viennese newspapers, first the socialistic Arbeiter-Zeitung and, after its closure, in exile journals and, finally, adopting a rather different tone and style, in the censored press of the corporate state under Chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg. working-class children who are taught the harsh rules of middle-class life at an early age, about the street violence during the workers' revolt in February 1934, and the lowly status of maids. Her favourite pseudonym, Veza Magd (maid), showed her allegiance to this marginalised group, whose sense of ethics underscores their dignity, which Canetti champions. they based on differences in class or sex or both. She is moralistic and engaged but funny; her stories are traditional rather than Chekhovian in their twists of plot and use of the final punchline. In his introduction Julian Preece shows how Veza Canetti was an unrivalled observer of the life of the Viennese poor on the eve of Nazism. Until now Veza Canetti's literary career was overshadowed by her more famous husband, Elias Canetti (1905-1994, Nobel Prize, 1981).

Though they are very young, she 18 and he 22, both are already engaged to be married: he to his cousin, a beautiful and imperious girl who sees him as a stepping stone to comfort and security, and she to a dissolute diplomat who needs her wealth to pay his gigantic gambling debts. They must both first realize the extraordinary power of their feelings, and then enter a terrible battle with relatives, expectations and conventions, where their difference in rank proves a massive obstacle. Their union will indeed be hard won, if it can be. As they fight to understand and fulfil their love, the world bends, breaks and remakes itself around them many times. In the uncertainty, one of them unwillingly marries; the other rejects passionately the idea of a life united to any but their loved one. Lives are lost, arguments are precipitated into great conflicts, scores are settled and new ones created, intrigues are pursued, misunderstandings are promoted, long-held secrets are finally revealed. It is only when a chance mistake proves disastrously final that their tragic love finds its whole meaning, that the pattern they are creating in their lives fulfils its extraordinary design. This intensely passionate novel, the author's second, was first published in 1832. George Sand (Amandine Dupin, afterwards Baroness Dudevant) was born in Paris in 1804. She was raised largely by her grandmother at the family estate of Nohant in Berri, a region of central France. After rebelling an unsuccessful marriage, she had affairs with authors Prosper Merimee and Alfred de Musset, composer Frederic Chopin, and the actress Marie Dorval, among others.

As we accompany her in her sometimes delirious, sometimes lucid journey, we are given rare glimpses of the inner thoughts and feelings of a woman confronting questions of love and intimacy within and outside of marriage. It is a story of one woman's quest for liberation, not from a repressive society or a male-dominated world that is easy and has been done many times before but from self-imposed taboos that inhibit a woman's ability to find fulfillment and to confront the many imponderables surrounding sexuality, desire, and love. Stuck by conscious choice to keep up the genteel appearances of her middle-class family in a loveless marriage to Mustafa, the forty-something Nahid finds love and sex with novelist and journalist Omar himself trapped in a loveless, but not sexless, marriage to Maggie. Although their love story is at the very heart of the novel, we are given broad glimpses of the larger picture of the world outside through Nahid's work as an archaeologist and Omar's as a journalist. The novel was well received by women readers, critics, and reviewers and by a majority of the male audience, while a vociferous minority of male critics felt scandalized by it, finding it unseemly that such issues should be raised by a woman.

The mosaic of family rooms, filtered through the feelings and eyes of narrators with heightened subjectivities, gives one the sense of what the country of lndonesia has gone through from time to time. The further away the protagonists roam from home, the stronger is the unspoken yearning for unraveling the traumas rooted at the center of the family homes.

Von allen Werken der Seghers ist er unumstritten das bekannteste. Er wendet ein popul\u00e4res, in der trivialen Unterhaltungskunst gern benutztes Erz\u00e4hlmuster an: eine Fluchtgeschichte. Sieben Gefangene sind aus dem KZ Westhofen entflohen. Sie haben die l\u00e4ngst und eindeutig gegen sie entschiedene Machtfrage neu gestellt.

Aber nur einem von ihnen gelingt die Flucht. Sie habe mit dieser Fluchtgeschichte, sagte Anna Seghers, die Struktur des ganzen Volkes aufrollen wollen. Aus der Perspektive des sozialen Romans schafft sie die bedeutendste analytische Darstellung der nationalsozialistisch formierten Gesellschaft. Der Roman zerlegt die Motive der funktionierenden Mitmacher, der kalkulierenden Karrieristen, der eingesch\u00fcchterten fr\u00fcheren Oppositionellen, der Funktionstr\u00e4ger des Regimes und derjenigen, die dem Fl\u00fcchtling helfen.

Her suicide was the culmination of thirteen years of mental crises which are described with disarming lucidity in The Man Of Jasmine, subtitled Impressions from a Mental Illness. Zurn's mental collapse was initiated when she encountered in the real world her childhood fantasy figure \"the man of jasmine\": he was the writer Henri Michaux, and her meeting him plunged her into a world of hallucination in which visions of her desires, anxieties and events from her unresolved past overwhelmed her present life. Her return to \"reality\" was constantly interrupted by alternate visionary and depressive periods. Zurn's compelling narrative also reveals her uneasy relationship with words and language, which she attempted to resolve by the compulsive writing of anagrams. Anagrams allowed her to dissect the language of everyday, to personalise it, and to make it reveal hidden at its core astonishing messages, threats and evocations. They formed the basis of her interpretation of the split between her inner & outer lives and underpin the texts included in this selection. The Man of Jasmine is certainly one of the greatest descriptions of mental collapse, but it is much more.

In Paradise of the Blind she has created a devastating portrait of three women fighting to maintain their dignity in a society that expects ever greater sacrifices from them.

In images of astonishing grace and power, and through her unforgettable gallery of women, Duong Thu Huong dazzles the reader with her ability to evoke the colors, the foods, the smells, and the age-old rituals of her country. At the center of the novel is Hang, a young woman forced to grow up too fast in the slums of Hanoi and the turbulence of modern Vietnam. Duong Thu Huong brilliantly captures Hang's rebellion against her mother and the loneliness of her search for self. There is Hang's mother, who watches, powerless, as her life is shattered by a fanatical political campaign led by her own brother. And there is the mysterious Aunt Tam, who has accumulated wealth and bitterness in equal parts and seeks to pass on both to her niece, Hang. The intoxicating beauty of the Vietnamese countryside, the hunger, the pride, the endurance of ordinary Vietnamese people confronted with the hypocrisy and corruption that surround them - all are here in this moving and lyrical novel.
