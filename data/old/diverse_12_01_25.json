One may wonder about what impact these stories will have if they are told again; whether people will remember them; and if they will get the attention they once had. The answer to these questions was the temptation behind this compilation. It led to an effort to bring these memories back to the forefront of people s minds. The hope is that people will eventually love them again the stories as well as the story makers. These stories are not fiction; some parts do have traces in history though they are not history either. The people in these stories were once well known but now their memory is buried under years and years of history. They can be likened, more than anything else, to old photographs in which faces are distorted by creases and the colors tarnished. Someone has made an effort to retouch them and brighten the rusty colors to his taste.

Amongst the humour, interwoven throughout the fabric of the text, the reader will find an astonishing depth to family ties and a familial closeness that clearly has far-reaching consequences. In this culture, members of both the immediate and extended family will stop at nothing in their efforts to help each other; we learn that troubled marriages can often be saved by the intervention of elders.
