It by no means follows that because a man is a sexton, and constantly surrounded by the emblems of mortality, therefore he should be a morose and melancholy man; your undertakers are the merriest fellows in the world; and I once had the honour of being on intimate terms with a mute, who in private life, and off duty, was as comical and jocose a little fellow as ever chirped out a devil-may-care song, without a hitch in his memory, or drained off the contents of a good stiff glass without stopping for breath. But, notwithstanding these precedents to the contrary, Gabriel Grub was an ill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow\u2014a morose and lonely man, who consorted with nobody but himself, and an old wicker bottle which fitted into his large deep waistcoat pocket\u2014and who eyed each merry face, as it passed him by, with such a deep scowl of malice and ill-humour, as it was difficult to meet, without feeling something the worse for. ", "\u201cA little before twilight, one Christmas Eve, Gabriel shouldered his spade, lighted his lantern, and betook himself towards the old churchyard; for he had got a grave to finish by next morning, and, feeling very low, he thought it might raise his spirits, perhaps, if he went on with his work at once. As he went his way, up the ancient street, he saw the cheerful light of blazing fires gleam through[2] the old casements, and heard the loud laugh and the cheerful shouts of those who were assembled around them; he marked the bustling preparations for next day\u2019s cheer, and smelt the numerous savoury odours consequent thereupon, as they steamed up from the kitchen windows in clouds. All this was gall and wormwood to the heart of Gabriel Grub: and when groups of children bounded out of the houses, tripped across the road, and were met, before they could knock at the opposite door, by half a dozen curly-headed little rascals who crowded round them as they flocked up-stairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games, Gabriel smiled grimly, and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp, as he thought of measles, scarlet-fever, thrush, hooping-cough, and a good many other sources of consolation besides. ", "\u201cIn this happy frame of mind, Gabriel strode along: returning a short, sullen growl to the good-humoured greetings of such of his neighbours as now and then passed him: until he turned into the dark lane which led to the churchyard. Now, Gabriel had been looking forward to reaching the dark lane, because it was, generally speaking, a nice, gloomy, mournful place, into which the townspeople did not much care to go, except in broad daylight, and when the sun was shining; consequently, he was not a little indignant to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry Christmas, in this very sanctuary, which had been called Coffin Lane ever since the days of the old abbey, and the time of the shaven-headed monks. As Gabriel walked on, and the voice drew nearer, he found it proceeded from a small boy, who was hurrying along, to join one of the little parties in the old street, and who, partly to keep himself company, and partly to prepare himself for the occasion, was shouting out the song at the highest pitch of his lungs. So Gabriel waited until the boy came up, and then dodged him into a corner, and rapped him over the head with his lantern five or six times, to teach him to modulate his voice."], "author": "Charles Dickens", "num_pages": "486", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2015-02-09 00:00:00"},

He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity. Dickens preferred the style of the 18th century picaresque novels that he found in abundance on his father's shelves. According to Ackroyd, other than these, perhaps the most important literary influence on him was derived from the fables of The Arabian Nights. His writing style is marked by a profuse linguistic creativity. Satire, flourishing in his gift for caricature, is his forte. An early reviewer compared him to Hogarth for his keen practical sense of the ludicrous side of life, though his acclaimed mastery of varieties of class idiom may in fact mirror the conventions of contemporary popular theatre. Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an \"allegorical impetus\" to the novels' meanings. To cite one of numerous examples, the name Mr. Murdstone in David Copperfield conjures up twin allusions to \"murder\" and stony coldness. His literary style is also a mixture of fantasy and realism. His satires of British aristocratic snobbery-he calls one character the \"Noble Refrigerator\"-are often popular. Comparing orphans to stocks and shares, people to tug boats, or dinner-party guests to furniture are just some of Dickens's acclaimed flights of fancy."], "author": "Charles Dickens", "num_pages": "80", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": null, "publish_date": "2015-09-28 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1517563356"},

It is a story of a young man who, born into confusion, eventually makes order of his own life -- usually despite, rather than because of, his family heritage. Perhaps the greatest of Dickens' orphans, David Copperfield is a happy child, living with his kind and gentle mother and nurse Peggotty, until his mother remarries. Unfortunately for David, his stepfather is the hard, cruel Mr. Murdstone, who brings his dark, life-crushing eminence into David's home, along with his equally cold and unyielding sister, Miss Murdstone. David's mother is powerless to stop their cruelties toward her young son -- and after one of literature's most-satisfying bites, David is sent away. After an idyllic visit with Peggotty's family at their upside-down boat house beside the sea, where David befriends dear little Em'ly, one of Dickens' most beloved characters, David is sent away to school. At school, he meets the formative friends of his life -- the ambiguous and handsome Steerforth, and the unlikely future hero, Tommy Traddles. After his frail mother's death, David once again returns home, where he makes the acquaintance of another of Dickens' great characters -- the improvident Mr. Micawber, he of many children -- loosely based on Dickens' own financially-incompetent father. After experiencing the chaos of the Micawber house, David then finds his outspoken aunt, Betsy Trotwood, and through her, meets Agnes Wickfield -- the young woman who eventually becomes his \"bright star, ever pointing upward.\" At this point, returning to school, David encounters the oily, hand-wringing, cringing Uriah Heep -- and no one's life will be the same again."], "author": "Charles Dickens", "awards": [], "places": ["United Kingdom"], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2007-02-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1603120548"},

Its star was a good-hearted orphan boy; its author was Charles Dickens; and by the time it concluded in March 1839, Oliver Twist would become one of the most beloved of Dickens' novels. First published in book form in 1838, it has never been out of print, and little wonder: it is the classic rags-to-riches story, and a foundation of modern popular fiction that is required and highly enjoyable reading for all lovers of literature.

Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 - 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's most memorable fictional characters and is generally regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian period. During his life, his works enjoyed unprecedented fame, and by the twentieth century his literary genius was broadly acknowledged by critics and scholars. His novels and short stories continue to be widely popular. Born in Portsmouth, England, Dickens was forced to leave school to work in a factory when his father was thrown into debtors' prison. Although he had little formal education, his early impoverishment drove him to succeed. Over his career he edited a weekly journal for 20 years, wrote 15 novels, five novellas and hundreds of short stories and non-fiction articles, lectured and performed extensively, was an indefatigable letter writer, and campaigned vigorously for children's rights, education, and other social reforms. Dickens sprang to fame with the 1836 serial publication of The Pickwick Papers. Within a few years he had become an international literary celebrity, famous for his humour, satire, and keen observation of character and society. His novels, most published in monthly or weekly installments, pioneered the serial publication of narrative fiction, which became the dominant Victorian mode for novel publication. The installment format allowed Dickens to evaluate his audience's reaction, and he often modified his plot and character development based on such feedback. For example, when his wife's chiropodist expressed distress at the way Miss Mowcher in David Copperfield seemed to reflect her disabilities, Dickens went on to improve the character with positive features. Fagin in Oliver Twist apparently mirrors the famous fence Ikey Solomon; His caricature of Leigh Hunt in the figure of Mr Skimpole in Bleak House was likewise toned down on advice from some of his friends, as they read episodes. In the same novel, both Lawrence Boythorne and Mooney the beadle are drawn from real life-Boythorne from Walter Savage Landor and Mooney from 'Looney', a beadle at Salisbury Square. His plots were carefully constructed, and Dickens often wove in elements from topical events into his narratives. Masses of the illiterate poor chipped in ha'pennies to have each new monthly episode read to them, opening up and inspiring a new class of readers."], "author": "Charles Dickens", "num_pages": "24", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": null, "publish_date": "2014-02-08 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1495484408"},
