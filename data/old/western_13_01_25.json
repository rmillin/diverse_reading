What was Alec doing in such a sleazy place? And who was the Italian-looking gentleman who registered for the room? The police first assume that the mob has disposed of Alec to settle some gambling debts. But the mob denies the charge, and Italians in general are outraged at the suggestion. Charlie's job is to calm the community and find the killer. Alec had borrowed a thousand dollars from his girlfriend on Sunday night, and had next gone to visit his great-aunt at a nursing home. After that, the movements that led to his death at the seedy motel are a mystery. Charlie's concentration is not helped by an apparently serendipitous encounter with an old would-be girlfriend.

The island is currently receiving much renewed attention because of proposals to make it a National Park, or a National Wilderness Area. Known for centuries as \"The Graveyard of the Atlantic,\" its forty-kilometre length has claimed over five hundred ships since the earliest adventurers and fishing vessels sailed to North America. Even today Sable presents serious problems to navigators. The home of the world's last herds of wild horses, the island is a fragile, shifting crescent of sand and grass whose beauty and violence has fascinated and inspired countless adventurers, writers, artists and scientists for over three hundred years. Bruce Armstrong takes the reader on a personal journey to Sable. He brings to life the early shipwrecks, lifesaving establishments and settlement attempts that have marked the island's long and varied history. There are ghost stories, tales of exceptional bravery, and first-hand impressions of the island left by men and women such as Sir Humphrey Gilbert, Dorothea Dix and Alexander Graham Bell. Contemporary material about Sable is based on interviews with some of the people who live in this lonely place as lifesavers, wireless operators, conservationists, and scientific observers; their experiences contribute an immediate sense of Sable's spirit and power. Many new colour photographs by island researcher Zoe Lucas are featured in this new edition. Sable Island is an imaginative and exciting journey to the world's northern Galapagos. It is also an eloquent plea for the preservation of a unique and timeless part of Nova Scotia.

The distinctive shape of the native sugar maple leaf was familiar to every settler of New France and then of British North America; it was the first emblem of the St. Jean Baptiste Society, founded in 1834, and in 1860 it was incorporated into the badge of the Royal Canadian Regiment. By Confederation, it was a widely accepted motif for the new nation; that year Alexander Muir composed \u201cThe Maple Leaf Forever,\u201d which served as its informal anthem. The majority of badges worn by soldiers of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in World War I incorporated the maple leaf into their design, and the Canadians who fought in Europe under a British flag returned home with a newly minted sense of national identity, made material by the maple leaf emblems they\u2019d worn into battle.", "Parliament\u2019s first two attempts to establish a distinct Canadian flag, in 1925 and 1946, ended in stalemate, and it was not until 1964, when the nation was almost a century old, that Prime Minister Lester Pearson dared to inaugurate the political debate that would decide the issue.

The second volume (1910-1921) portrays Montgomery in the midst of great upheaval, both in her life and in the world around her.

Here she writes of the triumphs and trials of being a best-selling author: growing fame; the successful midwifery of her new heroines Emily and Marigold and a more adult novel, The Blue Castle; the struggle to allocate time for correspondence with publishers, fans, friends--and to actually write. We trace the happy conclusion of her lawsuits against an unscrupulous publisher and the disappointing outcome of a lawsuit arising in a minor automobile accident. And we learn of her personal worries: Ewan Macdonalds's envy of his wife's publishing and social success; the dark shadow cast by his attacks of melancholia; and her fear that her sons might evince similar tendencies. ", " In these years, Lucy Maud Montgomery turned more and more to her journals to record her insights, opinions, and epiphanies.

He also has a girlfriend, Jenny, daughter of one of the mahjong ladies who owns a corner grocery shop. Meanwhile, China is suffering during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, and soon the whole world is at war. Boys at school are enlisting, and many Chinese have gone back to fight for the old country.

There is only one answer; she must have a series of operations. Her dread of doctors and hospitals brings back troubling memories of helicopters, a field hospital, and another operation in Vietnam. It won't stop Tuyet, despite her fears and her overwhelming shyness. She has always dreamed of having two straight legs, of walking and running, of playing with other children, of owning a pair of shoes that actually match. Now that she has been given a chance, Tuyet is determined to do what it takes to finally stand on her own two feet."], "author": "Marsha Forchuk Skrypuch", "num_pages": "128", "awards": ["Children\u2019s Literature Roundtables of Canada Information Book Award Nominee (2013)", "OLA Forest of Reading Silver Birch Award for Non-Fiction (2014)"], "places": ["Brantford, Ontario"], "character_names": ["Tuyet Morris"], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2012-09-04 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1927485029"},

It included the surreal pedagogy of \"5 minutes with the Communist Manifesto\" (the digitally remastered version) and \"5 minutes with/without the ground,\" a story about airplanes and war that proved to be creepily prescient in September 2001. \"I feel perfectly fine\" was the third volume in the Backwards Versions trilogy of chapbooks. THE WORTHWHILE FLUX collects the best of the author's chapbooks along with newer performance pieces and some never-before-seen writing. And, although the stories and photographs will now be forever fixed on the page, the experience is still definitely worthwhile. Corey Frost has received wide acclaim for his self-published chapbooks and his multi-media performances that reverberate with surrealist wit and proletarian pop. He has travelled extensively, including two tours of duty on the unique Perpetual Motion Roadshow in Canada and the US, and performance tours of Europe and Australia. Currently he is pursuing a PhD and lives in Brooklyn, NY."], "author": "Corey Frost", "num_pages": "144", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2004-12-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "189499406X"},

His account is made all the more extraordinary by virtue of the fact that such interaction between whites and the tribes of the Pacific Northwest was virtually unheard of and certainly never before (and seldom since) written about in such detail.", "In his self-effacing way, a modest Jewitt explains how his work ethic, his friendly nature and his willingness to accept the native peoples as his equal endeared him to many of his captors. He even married a local maiden who bore him a son \u2013 though he makes little mention of this in his writings other than admitting his wife was very pleasing on the eye. (Georgian era attitudes perhaps dissuaded him from revealing more).", "Such was his eye for detail, John Jewitt leaves the reader with a clear understanding of the Mowachahts\u2019 customs, language, daily work habits, hygiene, trading, hunting, whaling and fishing techniques, diet and food preparation, potlatches, housing (they lived in lodges left by Spanish visitors), tree-felling and canoe-making, toolmaking and weapons, worship, feuds and settlement of intertribal disputes.

Tichelaar, PH.D. and author of the award-winning Narrow Lives What if you lived in a world where homosexuality was the norm and all forms of heterosexual behavior were illegal? In the near future the human population has grown to such excess that the earth is no longer able to sustain humanity's astronomical numbers. Poverty, starvation, and disease are rampant. Only the country of Hadrian seems able to defend itself against the ravages of overpopulation by restricting its growth and encasing its country behind a defensive wall. Procreation does not happen by chance in Hadrian. There are no unwanted pregnancies. No accidents. All pregnancies occur through in vitro fertilization, and every citizen is responsible for rearing one of Hadrian's children. Heterosexuality is deemed the ill that has led humanity to the brink. In Hadrian, no one dares to express interest in the opposite sex; to do so would result in exile or reeducation. Hadrian's Lover tells the story of Todd Middleton, a teenage boy struggling to keep the secret of his heterosexuality. Read on, and feel with him as he suffers the indignities of a society determined to \"cure\" him of his plight.

Point St. Charles is an industrial slum in Montreal which is now in the process of gentrification, but during Kathy Dobson\u2019s childhood, people moved for one of two reasons: their apartment was on fire or the rent was due. When student social workers and medical students from McGill University invaded the Point in the 1970s, Kathy and her five sisters witnessed their mother transform from a defeated welfare recipient to an angry, confrontational community organizer who joined in the fight against a city that turned a blind eye on some of its most vulnerable citizens. When her mother won the right for Kathy and her two older sisters to attend schools in one of Montreal\u2019s wealthiest neighborhoods, Kathy was thrown into a foreign world with a completely different set of rules that she didn't know\u2014leading to disastrous results. This compelling, coming-of-age story documents a time of great social change in Montreal and reveals the workings of an educational system trying to deal with disadvantaged children."], "author": "Kathy Dobson", "num_pages": "224", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2012-04-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1550653237"},

His conflicts are both internal and external, locking him in an unceasing struggle for survival; sometimes the sea is his enemy, sometimes his own rude behavior, sometimes his best friend Gershom Born, sometimes his secret love for the island teacher Mary Dauphiny; but always, inevitably, his Jung relatives and their manifold ambitions for money and power.", "The balance of life on Rockbound is precarious and thus fiercely guarded by all who inhabit its lonely domain, but just as a sudden change in the direction of the wind can lead to certain peril at sea, so too can the sudden change in the direction of a man's heart lead to a danger altogether unknown.", "Enormously evocative of the power, terror, and dramatic beauty of the Atlantic sea, and unrelenting in its portrait of back-breaking labour, cunning bitterness, and family strife, Rockbound is a story of many passions-love, pride, greed, and yearning -- all formed and buffeted on a small island by an unyielding wind and the rocky landscape of the human spirit.", "Roockbound won Canada Reads in 2005."], "author": "Frank Parker Day", "num_pages": "326", "awards": ["CBC Canada Reads (2005)"], "places": ["Canada"], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "1989-05-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0802067239"},

He was a changed man when he returned \u2013 socialist in his politics, sympathetic to labour, a friend to activists and writers in radical causes. Suddenly and surprisingly, he went to Ottawa for two mostly unhappy years as a public servant in the Privy Council Office.

He even recorded his in-depth psychoanalysis in Paris. This personal side of Trudeau has never been revealed before \u2013 and it sheds light on the politician and statesman he became.", "Volume One ends with his entry into politics, his appointment as Minister of Justice, his meeting Margaret and his election as leader of the Liberal Party and Prime Minister of Canada. There, his genius and charisma, his ambition and intellectual prowess, his ruthlessness and emotional character and his deliberate shaping of himself for leadership played out on the national stage and, when Lester B. Pearson announced his retirement as prime minister in 1968, there was but one obvious man for the job: Pierre Trudeau.", "\u2013from "], "author": "John English", "num_pages": "576", "awards": ["Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing Nominee (2006)", "J.W.

Champlain was also a brilliant navigator. He went to sea as a boy and over time acquired the skills that allowed him to make twenty-seven Atlantic crossings without losing a ship.", "But we remember Champlain mainly as a great explorer. On foot and by ship and canoe, he traveled through what are now six Canadian provinces and five American states. Over more than thirty years he founded, colonized, and administered French settlements in North America. Sailing frequently between France and Canada, he maneuvered through court intrigue in Paris and negotiated among more than a dozen Indian nations in North America to establish New France. Champlain had early support from Henri IV and later Louis XIII, but the Queen Regent Marie de Medici and Cardinal Richelieu opposed his efforts. Despite much resistance and many defeats, Champlain, by his astonishing dedication and stamina, finally established France's New World colony. He tried constantly to maintain peace among Indian nations that were sometimes at war with one another, but when he had to, he took up arms and forcefully imposed a new balance of power, proving himself a formidable strategist and warrior.", "Throughout his three decades in North America, Champlain remained committed to a remarkable vision, a Grand Design for France's colony. He encouraged intermarriage among the French colonists and the natives, and he insisted on tolerance for Protestants. He was a visionary leader, especially when compared to his English and Spanish contemporaries -- a man who dreamed of humanity and peace in a world of cruelty and violence.", "This superb biography, the first in decades, is as dramatic and exciting as the life it portrays.

When they first meet on a trolley platform, Bess immediately recognizes the chemistry between them, and the feeling is mutual. ", "But the hopes of young love are constrained by the 1915 conventions of Niagara Falls, Ontario. Tom's working-class pedigree doesn't suit Bess's family, despite their recent fall from grace. Sacked from his position at a hydroelectric power company, Bess's father has taken to drink, forcing her mother to take in sewing for the society women who were once her peers. Bess pitches in as she pines for Tom, but at her young age, she's unable to fully realize how drastically her world is about to change. ", "Set against the resounding backdrop of the falls, Cathy Marie Buchanan's carefully researched, capaciously imagined debut novel entwines the romantic trials of a young couple with the historical drama of the exploitation of the river's natural resources. The current of the river, like that of the human heart, is under threat: \"Sometimes it seems like the river is being made into this measly thing,\" says Tom, bemoaning the shortsighted schemes of the power companies. \"The river's been bound up with cables and concrete and steel, like a turkey at Christmastime.\" ", "Skillfully portraying individuals, families, a community, and an environment imperiled by progress and the devastations of the Great War, ", " beautifully evokes the wild wonder of its setting, a wonder that always overcomes any attempt to tame it. But at the same time, Buchanan's tale never loses hold of the gripping emotions of Tom and Bess's intimate drama. The result is a transporting novel that captures both the majesty of nature and the mystery of love.", "Also, download the free study guide: ", "."], "author": "Cathy Marie Buchanan", "num_pages": "307", "awards": [], "places": ["Niagara Falls, Ontario"], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2009-08-25 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1401340970"},

Mr. Thorrin wants Dave to participate in gambling, stock manipulation and extreme betting, all based on this belief. Complicating Dave's life further is his strained relationship with his father, a lifelong compulsive gambler.

This book chronicles his life among Metis trappers and native people as they struggle to eke out a living in a brutal environment. In the spring of 1947, putting the death and devastation of WWII behind him, Mowat joined a scientific expedition. In the remote reaches of Manitoba, he witnessed an Eskimo population ravaged by starvation and disease brought about by the white man. In his efforts to provide the natives with some of the assistance that the government failed to provide, Mowat set out on an arduous journey that collided with one of nature's most arresting phenomena\u2014the migration of the Arctic's caribou herds. Mowat was based at Windy Post with a Metis trapper and two Ihalmiut children. A young girl, known as Rita, is painted with special vividness\u2014checking the trap lines with the men, riding atop a sled, smoking a tiny pipe. Farley returns to the North two decades later and discovers the tragic fate that befell her. Combining his exquisite portraits with awe-inspiring passages on the power of nature, No Man's River is another riveting memoir from one of North America's most beloved writers."], "author": "Farley Mowat", "num_pages": "320", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2006-01-06 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0786716924"},

For the McCarthys, it is \"the best of both worlds.\" And they are a happy family. Jack and Mimi are still in love, Madeleine and her older brother, Mike, get along as well as can be expected. They all dance together and barbecue in the snow. They are compassionate and caring. Yet they have secrets. ", "Centralia is the station where, years ago, Jack crashed his plane and therefore never went operational; instead of being killed in action in 1943, he became a manager. Although he is successful, enjoys \"flying a desk\" and is thickening around the waist from Mimi's good Acadian cooking, deep down Jack feels restless. His imagination is caught by the space race and the fight against Communism; he believes landing a man on the moon will change the world, and anything is possible. When his old wartime flying instructorappears out of the blue and asks for help with the secret defection of a Soviet scientist, Jack is excited to answer the call of duty: now he has a real job. ", "Madeleine's secret is \"the exercise group.\" She is kept behind after class by Mr. March, along with other little girls, and made to do \"backbends\" to improve her concentration. As the abusive situation worsens, she is convinced that she cannot tell her parents and risk disappointing them. No one suspects, even when Madeleine's behaviour changes: in the early sixties people still believe that school is \"one of the safest places.\" Colleen and Ricky, the adopted Metis children of her neighbours, know differently; at the school they were sent to after their parents died, they had been labelled \"retarded\" because they spoke Michif. ", "Then a little girl is murdered. Ricky is arrested, although most people on the station are convinced of his innocence. At the same time, Ricky's father, Henry Froelich, a German Jew who was in a concentration camp, identifies the Soviet scientist hiding in the nearby town as a possible Nazi war criminal. Jack alone could provide Ricky's alibi, but the Cold War stakes are politically high and doing \"the right thing\" is not so simple. \"Show me the right thing and I will do it,\" says Jack. As this very local murder intersects with global forces, The Way the Crow Flies\" \"reminds us that in time of war the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. ", "Ann-Marie MacDonald said in a discussion with Oprah Winfrey about her first book, \"a happy ending is when someone can walk out of the rubble and tell the story.\" Madeleine achieves her childhood dream of becoming a comedian, yet twenty years later sherealises she cannot rest until she has renewed the quest for the truth, and confirmed how and why the child was murdered.. \"Publishers Weekly,\"\" \"in a starred review, called The Way the Crow Flies\" \"\"absorbing, psychologically rich...a chronicle of innocence betrayed.\" With compassion and intelligence, and an unerring eye for the absurd as well as the confusions of childhood, MacDonald evokes the confusion of being human and the necessity of coming to terms with our imperfections."], "author": "Ann-Marie MacDonald", "num_pages": "721", "awards": ["Lambda Literary Award Nominee for Lesbian Fiction (2004)", "Canadian Booksellers Association Libris Award for Fiction Book (2004)", "Mikael Agricola -palkinto (2005)"], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2003-09-23 00:00:00", "ISBN": "0676974082"},

Born in 1905, Daisy Stone Goodwill drifts through the roles of child, wife, widow, and mother, and finally into her old age. Bewildered by her inability to understand her place in her own life, Daisy attempts to find a way to tell her story within a novel that is itself about the limitations of autobiography.

Daisy's struggle to find a place for herself in her own life is a paradigm of the unsettled decades of our era.
