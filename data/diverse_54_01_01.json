Since she is now single, she is free to follow her plan to increase her environmental skills and that includes getting closer to Fox in a more personal way. By gaining his trust she hopes he will share his secrets and that in turn will lead her to the TimberBeast. With or without Fox, her plan is to wrap up her mission before winter sets in, but life in the forest is never predictable or safe, even when your friends are larger than life loggers. Ecoterrorists in the woods keep everyone on their toes. They ramp up their plans to stop the loggers and they don't care who gets hurt. Kelsy finds herself in a tangle of danger, possibilities and decisions. She expands her plans and spends more time with the loggers who bring new insights and doubts to her spying. But when Fox decides to focus his attention on more than friendship, Kelsy finds out that politics and the late summer weather aren't the only things heating up in the forest. Fox isn't shy about letting Kelsy know that he has more than her personal protection on his mind. He pushes her boundaries and teaches her about more than forest life. The truth she does not want to see, and the dangerous implications of knowing too much make her carefully laid plans spin out of control. Kelsy uses her new friends to find the TimberBeast so she can keep her winter deadline, but Fox has different ideas.
