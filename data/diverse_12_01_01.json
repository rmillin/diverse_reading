The Royal Enigma uniquely mixes fiction and fact to tell the epic story of the 2001 assassination of the Nepalese royal family and its ongoing impact on the people of Nepal. Chapters detailing actual events alternate with the fictional life of Nawin, his life a personal mirror on the larger tragic national events. The Royal Enigma tells a real life story in a very different and appealing way. For years, Nepal was savaged by a civil war. On one side were the King and the democratically elected government (not quite the same thing), on the other side were brutal Maoist revolutionaries who terrorized the countryside. After years of war, one night most of the Nepalese royal family was assassinated. The official story? The Crown Prince shot all of them and then himself because he could not marry the woman he loved. The story most Nepalese believe? The King was assassinated because he was secretly working with the Maoists to destroy the democratically elected government. The Royal Enigma presents all the known facts and theories behind the assassinations. It is a great novel for anyone interested in real life political conspiracies! The story of the civil war is paralleled by chapters focusing on the disruption and corruption it brought to Nepalese society. That story is personified in Nawin and his family and friends. He leaves his family responsibilities of looking after his step-mother and disabled half-brother, and instead becomes a pharmaceutical salesperson working from Kathmandu. Nawin and the colourful people he meets illustrate traditional Nepalese culture along with the intrusion of outside elements.

He finds them gentle, laughing lambs compared to the ravening wolves of his white brothers, left behind in America and on an American whaleship. The ugliest beast on earth is the white man, says Melville. In short, Herman found in Typee the paradise he was looking for. It is true, the Marquesans were 'immoral', but he rather liked that. Morality was too white a trick to take him in. ...There they are, these South Sea Islanders, beautiful big men with their golden limbs and their laughing, graceful laziness.

In 1916, Douglas fled England to, in his own words, \"avoid persecution for kissing a boy and giving him some cakes and a shilling.\" The sixteen-year-old boy in question described the matter less innocently to police, leading Douglas to be charged with indecent assault. Douglas settled in Capri. His book of travel Together, published in 1923, finds him traveling with a companion he refers to as \"Mr R,\" who in fact was a fifteen-year-old Italian boy who went by the name of Ren\u00e9.", "Douglas was admired by E.M. Forster and Lytton Strachey (\"the thrill that only you can give goes down my back,\" Strachey wrote to him after reading Together), and more recently by Paul Fussell, who likens him to Nabokov. D.H. Lawrence was fascinated with Douglas enough to base the character James Argyle on him in Aaron's Rod. Indeed, Lawrence uses Argyle to make one of his more profound statements on love between men, the same sort of statement found in the final pages of Women in Love. Addressing the Marchesse, Argyle says, \"A man is drawn or driven. Driven, I've found it. Ah, my dear fellow, what is life but a search for a friend-that sums it up.\" The Marchesse smiles and adds, \"Or a lover,\" to which Argyle rejoins, \"Same thing, same thing...\"", "An even more intriguing characterization of Douglas is found in Roger Williams's Lunch with Elizabeth David. The book is written from the point of view of twelve-year-old Eric Wolton, a working class boy Douglas took with him through Calabria. In Julie Gray's review of the book for the New York Times (13 Aug 2000), she writes, \"The question at the novel's center concerns Douglas: Is he, as one character puts it, 'a monster, the pedophile of the century,' or is he, as Eric says, a great man who had led him into a 'warm and sensuous world of adventures and light'?\" Eric, no doubt, would insist he should have the final word.", "As for Douglas, his final words, after intentionally taking an overdose of pills to end a prolonged illness, are reported to have been: \"Get those fucking nuns away from me.\""], "author": "Norman Douglas", "num_pages": "136", "awards": [], "places": [], "character_names": [], "language": "English", "publish_date": "2014-10-01 00:00:00", "ISBN": "1502560119"},

", "With astonishing empathy and the effortless grace of a natural storyteller, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie weaves together the lives of three characters swept up in the turbulence of the decade. Thirteen-year-old Ugwu is employed as a houseboy for a university professor full of revolutionary zeal. Olanna is the professor\u2019s beautiful mistress, who has abandoned her life of privilege in Lagos for a dusty university town and the charisma of her new lover.

As Nigerian troops advance and the three must run for their lives, their ideals are severely tested, as are their loyalties to one another. ", "Epic, ambitious, and triumphantly realized, Half of a Yellow Sun is a remarkable novel about moral responsibility, about the end of colonialism, about ethnic allegiances, about class and race\u2014and the ways in which love can complicate them all.

", "Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life\u2014having nothing but his own wits to help him along. ", "Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of Murder Weekly (\"Love -- Rape -- Revenge!\"), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive. ", "Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations. ", "The White Tiger recalls The Death of Vishnu and Bangkok 8 in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own.
