Never one to miss an opportunity for genealogical research;methodical and meticulous Molly plans a side trip to Ukraine. Intriguingly, her mother, Judith, evokes a favorite Yiddish proverb, 'Man plans and God laughs.' ", "If Judith had her way, her daughter would still be dressing up in fairy wings and princess crowns- collecting wild flowers and connecting with her spiritual energy, but for Molly; making plans and compiling data came as second nature. She and her father had delighted in spending long, cozy, afternoons cuddled in the library studying ancient family history. David Abramovitz began recounting tales of great-grandparents trekking across Mother Russia when his daughter was still quite young. Captivated, Molly learned how her relatives boarded a ship and sailed across the ocean to reach the shores of Argentina. ", "Now, at last, Molly's plans are coming to fruition. Her trek to her ancestral home leads her to an accidental discovery of a mythical tarot card. Will the life lessons revealed on this enchanted journey shake up her staid and uncomplicated life?

It features Annie Gomez and her \"coterie\" of fellow outcasts. Annie Gomez, having just completed 10th grade, wrestles with being the smartest person she knows (and probably the smartest person ever) and yet having to deal with absurd parents, thick classmates, and saving the world from aliens (or possibly fairies.) Fortunately, Annie isn't quite totally alone. Her circle of carefully chosen friends include Andy, half Inuit, half African-American, who once played Anne Frank on stage; Johnny, a shy Romany boy who loves history; Naomi, a sophisticated, mature woman of the world (ok, 16 year old of the world); Justin, who still looks like a 6th grader (and a golden retriever) but plays trombone with a world-class jazz band and is the high schools leading expert in exobiology - the study of alien life; and finally Aaron, whose brilliant mind is beyond the ken of ordinary humans. Aaron is autistic, rarely speaks, and spends his time in realms that are imaginary. Or are they? On the last day of the school year Annie's biology teacher warns her that he believes aliens are trying to take over her mind. \"Why not?\" she shrugs. \"Everyone else is.\" Yet as she continues to lose her grip on reality over the next weeks, she has no choice but to accept the possibility. As events unfold, Annie finds that not one but two different alien races are trying to contact her. One is trying to help. One is trying to destroy humanity. But which is which? Feeling totally helpless for the first time in her life, Annie is pulled first by one and then the other into strange and dangerous landscapes. And her friends (except Aaron, mysteriously disappears) are pulled with her, which is probably a good thing, she figures. A fortune teller told her that she had to learn to trust others (\"yeah, right\") but that in the end she would have to depend on her own resources (\"hey, can't someone help me out here?\"). At the last minute she makes her final effort, deploying her secret weapon, only to be used when there are no other options. And it fails. With no hope left she finds herself locked in mortal, hand-to-hand combat with a terrifying, powerful alien, a battle that will determine whether humanity survives. Her strength failing, she faces the very real probability of her own death and please don't tell this to ANYONE but she realizes she really loves her parents. Will she prevail at the last minute?

She was born into a poor Latino family living in a small crummy apartment in the barrio side of town, where the graffiti chiseled more the souls and character of the residents than it impacted the exterior looks of the buildings. Her father was a drunken, gambler, and wife-beater who, one cold night, got arrested after a violent intrusion. Her entire circle of relatives consisted of nothing but formers-former drug-addicts, former gangsters and gang-bangers, former alcoholics, former everything. Yep, her life was nothing but a huge load of crap. And she hadn't even started high school yet. After surviving a scorching summer heat, Esperanza enters the unfamiliar world of high-school with a tight knot in her stomach. On the very first day, she is sucked into a blunder of catastrophic events beginning with accidentally running into the world's BIGGEST bully. Now, she has made herself the prime target for a main course. And, to top it all off, she has to see this girl everyday in P.E! P.E.-the one class Esperanza truly despises the most. Could life be any worse for her? Well, her family could take in a relative hopped up on drugs, a probable shooting can take place right in front of her, and Esperanza could also sit and listen to the crazed ranting of her loud psychotic mother. Oh, wait, all that does happen. To make things even easier, her best friend, Carla, won't stop trying to marry her off to her twin brother, Carlos. And she has these two puny siblings constantly vying for her attention. God, it's a wonder she doesn't strap herself in a straight jacket and pretend to be Elvis. Nonetheless, Esperanza attempts to get through it all. She is a smart and ambitious young kid struggling to survive her life while fighting to make her mark on the world. Her story is filled with pain, strength, and too much loud bickering. It carries a voice enriched with barrio slang and sarcastic humor. Esperanza illustrates what persistent Latino youth can achieve when they get back up after a fall and keep on walking straight into college. \"Esperanza is an admirable and too real story of many Latino youths lacking role models, who find themselves lost and isolated in the paved jungles of the inner cities and overwhelmed by the dissonance of barrio life. Sandra C. Lopez has created a resilient and likeable character, Esperanza, who seems closer to a naked truth-seeker than to a barrio kid-desperately trying to get out of a crappy world, but not knowing exactly where she was going to.
